AI-Based Customer Churn Predictor

Predict. Prevent. Profit.
An intelligent Machine Learning system that identifies customers likely to leave — before they actually do.

📌 Project Overview

Traditional churn models only say “Will churn” or “Will not churn.”
Our system goes beyond that.

We provide a risk-based classification system:

🔴 High Risk – Immediate retention action required

🟡 Medium Risk – Monitor & engage strategically

🟢 Low Risk – Stable customers

This allows businesses to prioritize resources efficiently instead of treating all customers the same.

🧠 What Makes It Different?
✅ 1. Risk-Level Segmentation

Instead of binary prediction, we:

Calculate churn probability

Categorize into High / Medium / Low risk groups

Enable tier-based retention strategies

✅ 2. Business-Oriented Output

Our model output is actionable, not just technical.

Example:

Customer	Churn Probability	Risk Level
A	0.82	High 🔴
B	0.47	Medium 🟡
C	0.12	Low 🟢
⚙️ How It Works

Data Preprocessing

Feature Engineering

Model Training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost)

Probability Prediction

Risk Categorization using thresholds:

0.70 – 1.00 → High Risk

0.40 – 0.69 → Medium Risk

0.00 – 0.39 → Low Risk

📊 Why Risk Segmentation Matters

Instead of:

“100 customers will churn.”

We say:

“25 are High Risk (urgent), 40 Medium (monitor), 35 Low (stable).”

This improves:
